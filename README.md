# Code Crafters Redis
1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.54)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
